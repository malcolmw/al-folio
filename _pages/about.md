Malcolm White is a Postdoctoral Associate studying seismology with Dr. Nori Nakata in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA. Malcolm is also an Adjunct Professor of Statistcs at Sattler College in Boston, MA. Malcolm's active research focuses on developing and applying computational techniques to observe seismogenic processes ranging from hydraulic-fracturing induced microseismicity to seismotectonic processes in major fault zones. Malcolm lives in Medford, MA with his wife Sara and daughter Anastasia.

Malcolm earned a BSc in Computational Geophysics from Carleton University (Ottawa, Canada) in 2013, following which he started working as a Seismic Analyst at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (University of California, San Diego). In 2016 he moved to the University of Southern California to start his PhD in Geological Sciences with Prof. Yehuda Ben-Zion. Malcolm received his PhD in August 2021, and subsequently began research at MIT as a Postdoctoral Associate and teaching at Sattler College as an Adjunct Professor.
