Malcolm White is a Postdoctoral Associate studying the dynamic solid Earth with Dr. Nori Nakata in the <a href='https://eapsweb.mit.edu'>EAPS</a> department at MIT. Malcolm's active research focuses on developing and applying computational techniques to observe seismogenic processes ranging from hydraulic-fracturing induced microseismicity to the tectonic evolution of plate boundaries. Malcolm lives in Medford, MA with his wife Sara and two children, Anastasia and Ezekiel.

Malcolm has a PhD in Geological Sciences (University of Southern California, 2021) and a BSc in Computational Geophysics (Carleton University, 2013). He worked at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (University of California, San Diego) as a Seismic Analyst from 2013-2016.
